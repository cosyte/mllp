 * The scaling gate's own Vitest run, `pnpm test:perf`: the tests that read a clock, run apart from
 * `pnpm test` and never under coverage. Coverage instrumentation compiles a counter into every
 * measured function, at a cost that does not cancel cleanly in a ratio, so `@cosyte/test-utils/perf`
 * asks for a run of its own.
 *
 * One file at a time in one fork, so no other test shares the machine with a timed phase.
