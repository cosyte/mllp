## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the v1 MLLP transport surface below. The package
begins its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- **MLLP client + server** — production-grade client and server with framing
  (`VT + payload + FS + CR`), ACK correlation, auto-reconnect with backoff, and backpressure.
  Buffer-first API on every public surface.
- **Explicit 6-state connection machine** — `CONNECTING | CONNECTED | DRAINING | RECONNECTING |
  DISCONNECTED | CLOSED`, with `stateChange` events carrying `{ from, to, reason }`.
- **Framing** — `FrameReader` with a bounded 16 MB default accumulator (`MLLP_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` on
  overflow); strict encoder, lenient decoder (Postel's Law).
- **11 stable warning codes** with byte-offset context (`MLLP_MISSING_LEADING_VT`,
  `MLLP_FS_WITHOUT_CR`, `MLLP_FRAME_TOO_LARGE`, `MLLP_ACK_UNMATCHED_CONTROL_ID`, …).
- **TLS** support; `AbortSignal` on every awaitable and `Symbol.asyncDispose` on every closeable.
- **In-memory transport** (`@cosyte/hl7-mllp/testing`) — a deterministic, socket-free test double.
- **`ack-from-hl7` subpath** — build ACKs from parsed messages via the optional `@cosyte/hl7` peer.
- **Tooling** — strict TypeScript, dual ESM + CJS via tsup, Vitest. Lint, format, and TypeScript
  settings come from the shared `@cosyte/*` config packages (ESLint 9). CI across Node 22 / 24.
