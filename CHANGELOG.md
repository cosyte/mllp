# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Versions and publishing are managed with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets);
this file is maintained by hand (Changesets handles the version bump and publish only).

## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the v1 MLLP transport surface below. The package
begins its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Security

- **Dev-dependency advisory remediation (no runtime impact — `@cosyte/mllp`
  ships zero runtime dependencies, so the published artifact is unchanged).**
  Added scoped `pnpm.overrides` pinning two transitive **dev/build-time**
  packages to their patched releases: `esbuild` (`>=0.27.3 <0.28.1` →
  `0.28.1`; GHSA dev-server path-traversal — not reachable here: the library
  builds via `tsup`/`vitest` and never runs `esbuild serve`) and the
  `@changesets/parse` copy of `js-yaml` (`>=4.0.0 <4.2.0` → `4.2.0`;
  GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68 merge-key DoS). The `js-yaml@3.14.2` pulled by
  `read-yaml-file@1.1.0` (via `@manypkg/get-packages` → `@changesets/cli`) is
  **intentionally left**: it calls `yaml.safeLoad`, removed/throwing in
  js-yaml 4, so it cannot be force-upgraded without breaking the release
  tooling, and it only parses trusted local repo YAML at release time. This is
  the shared canonical override block, enforced suite-wide by the
  `@cosyte/config` drift check.

### Added

- **MLLP client + server** — production-grade client and server with framing
  (`VT + payload + FS + CR`), ACK correlation, auto-reconnect with backoff, and backpressure.
  Buffer-first API on every public surface.
- **Explicit 6-state connection machine** — `CONNECTING | CONNECTED | DRAINING | RECONNECTING |
  DISCONNECTED | CLOSED`, with `stateChange` events carrying `{ from, to, reason }`.
- **Framing** — `FrameReader` with a bounded 16 MB default accumulator (`MLLP_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` on
  overflow); strict encoder, lenient decoder (Postel's Law).
- **11 stable warning codes** with byte-offset context (`MLLP_MISSING_LEADING_VT`,
  `MLLP_FS_WITHOUT_CR`, `MLLP_FRAME_TOO_LARGE`, `MLLP_ACK_UNMATCHED_CONTROL_ID`, …).
- **TLS** support; `AbortSignal` on every awaitable and `Symbol.asyncDispose` on every closeable.
- **In-memory transport** (`@cosyte/mllp/testing`) — a deterministic, socket-free test double.
- **`ack-from-hl7` subpath** — placeholder for building ACKs from parsed messages via the optional
  `@cosyte/hl7` peer (helpers not yet implemented; Phase 6).
- **Property + fuzz test layer** for the framing transport, built on the shared
  `@cosyte/test-utils` conformance kit and `fast-check` (both dev-only). Covers: codec round-trip
  byte fidelity (`encode → decode`) via `roundTripProperty`; lenient-decoder robustness
  (malformed-but-recoverable frames recover into warnings, only `MLLP_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` throws) via
  `lenientNeverThrowsProperty`; frozen-event-payload immutability via `immutabilityProperty`; a
  warning-code surface snapshot tripwire via `sortedCodeSet`; and a transport-robustness **fuzz**
  property feeding arbitrary random byte buffers and chunk-splits through `FrameReader` over the
  in-memory transport. Test-only — no public-surface change.

- **Fail-safe ACK semantics & the commit contract (Phase 6, HL7 v2.5.1 §2.9.2).** A positive
  acknowledgement (`AA`) can never precede a successful durable commit: with `autoAck: 'AA'` + an
  `onMessage` handler the server **awaits the handler (the commit step) then ACKs** — `AA` on resolve,
  a **negative** code on throw/reject (`AE` by default; `AR` via `MllpAckError`), never `AA` before
  commit. `autoAck: 'AA'` without a handler is a documented **transport-accept** (received+framed, not
  application-processed). New public surface: `buildRawAck` (parser-free byte-level ACK builder echoing
  inbound `MSH-10` into `MSA-2`, never throwing on malformed input), the HL7 Table 0008 `AckCode` /
  `NegativeAckCode` unions, `MllpAckError`, `resolveNackCode`, and a PHI-safe `'nack'` event
  (`{ connectionId, ackCode }`) with its `NackEvent` type. No payload content or thrown error text ever
  reaches the wire, logs, or events — only routing/control metadata and the static ack code.
- **Package metadata** — added `homepage` and `bugs` fields to `package.json` for npm completeness.

### Changed

- **Renamed the package `@cosyte/hl7-mllp` → `@cosyte/mllp`.** Not yet published, so no deprecation
  path is needed; all imports, the `/testing` and `/ack-from-hl7` subpaths, and the optional
  `@cosyte/hl7` peer dependency are unchanged.
- **Adopted the shared `@cosyte/*` engineering standard (Phase E).** Build via `@cosyte/tsup-config`
  (`cosyteTsup`), tests via `@cosyte/vitest-config` (`cosyteVitest`), lint via `@cosyte/eslint-config`
  (ESLint 10 + `typescript-eslint`) at `--max-warnings=0`, Prettier 3.8. Exact-pinned dev tooling,
  canonical scripts (incl. `clean`, `attw --pack .`), per-condition `.d.cts` types on every `exports`
  subpath, and thin-caller `ci.yml` / `release.yml` over `cosyte/.github`. Target bumped ES2022 →
  ES2023.
- **Re-enabled the coverage gate** at per-directory >= 90 on
  `framing|client|connection|server|transport` (was disabled).
- **Restored the JSDoc `error` gate** (the local `warn` downgrade was removed) and reformatted the
  source to the shared Prettier config (double quotes); no behavior change.

### Removed

- **`mitata` benchmark dependency and the `bench` script** — the script had no benchmark files.
